- Notes -
Important  notes
The  general  emergency  signal  
consists  of  7 short  and  one  long  
tone,  which  sounds  over  the  ship's  
loudspeaker  system.  As  soon  as  you  
hear  this  signal,  even  if the  yacht  is 
in  port,  please  return  to  your  cabin  
immediately.  Please  put  on  your  
lifejacket  and  warm  clothing  
(Personal  Survival  Kit)  and  go  to  your  
assembly  point,  which  is also  
indicated  on  your  door.
When  you  arrive  at  your  meeting  
point,  a crew  member  will  check  
your  name  off  a checklist.  The  
checklist  is created  before  each  trip  
and  tells  the  crew  which  meeting  
point  you  have  been  assigned  to  
and  what  special  needs  you  have.
If for  some  reason  you  are  unable  
to  go  back  to  your  cabin  to  get  your  
life  jacket  (and  your  personal  
survival  kit),  don't  worry.
A  life  jacket  (and  your  personal 
survival pack) can also  be  handed  
out  to  you  at  the  meeting  point .
The  lifejacket  is equipped  with  a 
light  and  inflates  automatically  when  
it comes  into  contact  with  seawater.  
If the  lifejacket  does  not
inflate,  it  can  be  inflated  by  manually  
pulling  on  the  red  tabs  you  received  
from  the  crew.
The  yacht  is equipped  with  low-level  
emergency  lighting  installed  in  the  
floors  of  the  corridors  to  guide  you  to  
an  exit  in  the  event  of  a power  failure.
It is important  that  you  do  not  use  the  
elevators  in  an  emergency,  as  they  
may  not  work  in  the  event  of  a power  
failure.
Please  be  careful  when  moving  around  
the  ship  as  the  decks  can  b e  slippery  
when  wet,  especially  in  the  pool  areas  
or  when  it has  rained.  Please  also  be  
aware  of  raised  thresholds  and  steps  
when  walking  through  doorways,  
especially  in  your  cabins.  We  also  ask  
you  to  use  handrails  when  walking  
through  the  corridors  and  using  the  
stairs.
The  yacht  has  a strict  environmental  
policy  and  uses  the  latest  technology  to  
reduce its  impact  on  the  environment.  It 
is important  that  all  waste  is processed  
on  board.  Therefore,  please  do  not  throw  
anything  overboard,  including  cigarettes  
or  cigars,  which  can  easily  be  drawn  back  
into  the  ship  and  start  a fire.

In  the  unlikely  event  that  the  ship

accommodated  in  the  lifeboats.  The  
order  to  leave  the  ship  will  be

whereupon  you  will  be  escorted  
from  the  assembly  point  to  your  
assigned  lifeboat  with  the  help  of  the  
crew.
