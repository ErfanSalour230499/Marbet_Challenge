for entry into 
Canada

Instructions  for applying  for the electronic  travel authorization  (eTA) to 
Canada
Before entering Canada, all travelers must obtain an electronic travel authorization (eTA). The eTA 
currently costs 7 CAD (as of February 2024) (approx. EUR 5.00) and is available on the official website: 
https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/apply-de.html
directly to the Government of Canada. 
Payment can only be made by credit card.
We recommend submitting the application as early as possible, but no later than 72 hours before departure for Canada, and not using 
any other VISA provider to ensure that the application and approval process runs smoothly.
Please check in advance whether your passport is still valid for at least 6 months after your return from Canada. 
If you have an existing and valid eTA travel authorization, you do not need a new application.
You will need the following documents for the application:
▪ a valid passport from a country that does not require a visa
▪ a valid e-mail address
▪Credit card
Important  additional information
The application and payment of the fee can only be made for one person at a time. For example, you must complete and submit 
three separate forms for a family of three.
Please make sure that you print out your receipt immediately. It is not possible to print it out at a later date. A copy can also no 
longer be issued.
The visa authority will only contact you by e-mail. Please also check your junk mail folder.
Your information will not be saved. You only have a limited amount of time to fill out the form for the
but you can extend your session if you need a little more time. If the window with the timeout warning is displayed, please click on 
the "Continue session" button. Make sure you have all the documents you need to complete the form with the help of the
