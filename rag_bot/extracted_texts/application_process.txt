Guide
to apply for the ESTA visa
for entry into the USA

Instructions for applying for the electronic travel authorization (ESTA) 
for the USA
Before entering the USA, all travelers must obtain an electronic travel authorization (ESTA). The ESTA 
currently costs $21 (as of February 2024) (approx. EUR 20.00) and is available on the official website:
https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/ directly to the CBP (border authority).
Payment is made by credit card or PayPal.
We recommend submitting the application as early as possible, but no later than 72 hours before departure for the USA, and not using 
any other VISA provider to ensure that the application and approval process runs smoothly.
Please check in advance whether your passport is still valid for at least 6 months after your return from the USA. If you 
have an existing and valid ESTA travel authorization, you do not need to apply for a new one.
You will need the following documents for the application:
▪ Passport and identity card
▪ Credit card or PayPal access data
▪ Contact details of your emergency contact and your employer
After receiving your ESTA authorization, please print it out and keep it in your hand luggage together with
your passport for entry and at the end of your trip for the border authorities.
If you have been in Cuba with your current passport on or after January 12, 2021, please contact us by phone 
at +49 791 49 380 162 or by e-mail at
